# Python-Project-Zepto-Sales-Analysis

📊 Sales Data Analysis & Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data to extract meaningful business insights.
Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, various visualizations are created to understand sales performance across products, cities, categories, and time periods.

The goal is to make the data easy to understand, visually appealing, and decision-friendly.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & aggregation

Matplotlib – Basic plotting

Seaborn – Advanced and aesthetic visualizations

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains sales-related information such as:

City

Product

Product Category

Total Sales Amount

Order Date

Delivery Time

The data is cleaned and aggregated before visualization.

📈 Visualizations Created
1️⃣ Top 5 Products by Sales Amount

Chart Type: Bar Chart

Purpose: Identify best-selling products

Insight: Helps understand which products contribute most to revenue

2️⃣ Total Sales by City

Chart Type: Bar Chart / Heatmap

Purpose: Compare city-wise performance

Insight: Highlights top-performing and low-performing cities

3️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend

Chart Type: Line Chart

Purpose: Track sales performance over time

Insight: Identifies seasonal trends and growth/decline patterns

4️⃣ Sales by Product Category

Chart Type: Pie Chart

Purpose: Show sales distribution across categories

Insight: Helps understand which category dominates overall sales

5️⃣ Delivery Time vs City

Chart Type: Heatmap / Bar Chart

Purpose: Analyze delivery performance by city

Insight: Identifies cities with faster or slower deliveries

🔥 Heatmap Example: City vs Sales

Darker colors represent higher sales

Lighter colors represent lower sales

Makes it easy to visually compare city performance at a glance

📌 Key Insights

Certain cities (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore) generate significantly higher sales

Monthly sales show noticeable trends instead of random fluctuations

A few product categories contribute most of the total revenue

Heatmaps provide quick visual comparison without reading numbers

▶️ How to Run the Project
